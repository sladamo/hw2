  <h3>Welcome!</h3>
  <p>
    Thanks for visiting my blog!
    Here I will document some of my amazing travels across the globe.
    I have visited 2 continents, 14 countries and 22 US states.
    Below, you will find some of my favorite memories, sorted by most recent first.
    My husband Frank is my favorite travel partner, so you will definitely see mention of him.
    Enjoy!

  <h3>Yellowstone National Park</h3>
  <p>
    In September 2015, we took the road trip of a lifetime out to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm"target="_blank">Yellowstone National Park</a> in western Wyoming.
    We left a piece of our hearts there; it is truly a special place, and we hope to visit it again some day.
    This picture was taken while visiting Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, one of many spectacular sites we saw!<br/>

  <h3>Carnival Cruise - Turks & Caicos and the Bahamas</h3>
  <p>
    Frank and I love cruising! In May 2014, we took our third cruise together, to celebrate our 1-year wedding anniversary.
    We became scuba certified on this trip, since we love diving, and wanted to go deeper than ever before.
    We dove <a href="http://www.carnival.com/shore-excursions/grand-turk/certified-scuba-440006#"target="_blank">"The Wall" in Turks & Caicos</a>, an exhilerating, world-renowned dive feautring a wall of coral that drops down 7,000 feet.
    Fortunately, we only dove to 90 feet, which was plenty of excitement for us!
    We saw nurse sharks, sea turtles, baracudas, and plenty of colorful fish and coral.<br/>

  <h3>Hawaii - Our Honeymoon on Maui and Kauai</h3>
  <p>
    We had both never been to Hawaii before, so it was an easy choice when deciding where to Honeymoon.
    Two days after our wedding in May 2013, we departed for 2 weeks on Maui and Kauai.
    We did more adventure activity on Maui, and more relaxation on Kauai, which was a perfect balance for a perfect trip.
    It is a very special place, and Chicago could use some serious Aloha!

  <ul>
    <li>Here we are at a sunset dinner on Maui at the <a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/maui/dining/restaurants/ferraros_bar_e_ristorante/"target="_blank">Four Seasons</a>.
    It was so perfect!
    I will never forget it.</li></ul>

    <li>Here we are exploring the famous <a href="http://www.napali.com/coast/"target="_blank">Napali Coast</a> by boat on Kauai.
    It was the last night of our Honeymoon before heading back to Chicago.
    After all this beauty, we sure could have used one more day!</li></ul>

  <h3>What's next?</h3>
  <p>
    Our next stop? We hope to visit Portland, Maine in Fall 2016!
    We have recenly become curious about this mysterious state, and exploring nature there.
    Perhaps we'll go white water rafting too!<br/>
